# Kafka Rust Client

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/spicavigo/kafka-rust.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/spicavigo/kafka-rust) [![](http://meritbadge.herokuapp.com/kafka)](https://crates.io/crates/kafka)

### Documentation

The [documentation](https://spicavigo.github.io/kafka-rust/) include some examples, too.


### Installation

This crate works with Cargo and is on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/kafka).  The API is currently under heavy movement although we do follow semantic versioning.

```toml
[dependencies]
kafka = "*"
```

To build kafka-rust you'll need `libsnappy-dev` on your local machine. If that library is not installed in the usual path, you can export the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable before issueing `cargo build`.


### Example:

As mentioned, the cargo generated documentation constains some examples. Further, standalone, compilable example programs are provided in the [examples directory of the repository](https://github.com/spicavigo/kafka-rust/tree/master/examples).

[KafkaClient](https://spicavigo.github.io/kafka-rust/kafka/client/struct.KafkaClient.html)
is the main entry point into the API. This is a mid-level abstraction
for Kafka.  Its main methods are:

* [Loading metadata](https://spicavigo.github.io/kafka-rust/kafka/client/struct.KafkaClient.html#method.load_metadata_all)
* [Fetching topic offsets](https://spicavigo.github.io/kafka-rust/kafka/client/struct.KafkaClient.html#method.fetch_offsets)
* [Sending messages](https://spicavigo.github.io/kafka-rust/kafka/client/struct.KafkaClient.html#method.send_messages)
* [Fetching message](https://spicavigo.github.io/kafka-rust/kafka/client/struct.KafkaClient.html#method.send_messages)
* [Committing a consumer group's offsets](https://spicavigo.github.io/kafka-rust/kafka/client/struct.KafkaClient.html#method.commit_offsets)
* [Fetching a consumer group's offsets](https://spicavigo.github.io/kafka-rust/kafka/client/struct.KafkaClient.html#method.fetch_group_topics_offset)

Many of these methods also have convenience partners acting on a
single topic or partition.


### [Consumer] (https://spicavigo.github.io/kafka-rust/kafka/consumer/index.html)

This is a simple higher-level Consumer for Kafka. It handles offset
management internally on behalf of a specified group and provides an
`Iterator` interface.


### [Creating a topic] (https://kafka.apache.org/08/quickstart.html)

Note unless otherwise explicitely stated in the documentation, this
library will ignore requests to topics which it doesn't know about. In
particular it will not send to or try to retrieve messages from not
yet existing topics.  Give your local kafka server installation you
can create topics if the following command (`kafka-topics.sh` is part
of the Kafka distribution):

```
kafka-topics.sh --topic my-topic --create --zookeeper localhost:2181  --partition 1 --replication-factor 1
```
